# cash_register_robbery
Cash register robbery made for DarkRP GMod. Addon is modified form n00bmobile's bank robbery addon (https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=389445061)

You can customize timers, prices etc. from /kassa_config.lua

Following commands can be used as superadmin or from console:
  
  kassakone_save
    - Saves currently active cash registers to the server
    - Map specific

  kassakone_wipe
    - Deletes all cash registers currently in the map
    - Map specific

It's not perfect and will probably never be. Do whatever you wish with it.
