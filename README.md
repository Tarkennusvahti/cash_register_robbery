# cash_register_robbery
Cash register robbery made for DarkRP GMod. Addon is modified form n00bmobile's bank robbery addon (https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=389445061)

You can customize timers, prices etc. from /kassa_config.lua

Following commands can be used as superadmin or from console:
  
  kassakone_save
    - Saves currently active cash registers to the server
    - Map specific

  kassakone_wipe
    - Deletes all cash registers currently in the map
    - Map specific

It's not perfect and will probably never be. Do whatever you wish with it. 
Also all the prints and texts ingame are in Finnish, have fun translating. Might change this later if people actually like this and use it.
